# 🤖 Parla Agente

An AI agent that **chats on your behalf** and then sends you a short summary of the conversation. Created for participation in the [Fetch.ai Hackathon](https://devpost.com/software/parla-agente-speaks-for-you-and-does-it-beautifully).

## 🧠 What the Agent Does

Parla Agente is now a **multi-agent system** designed to simulate natural conversations and deliver concise summaries — so you don’t have to reply to every message.

### 1. `Chat Agent` (hosted on Agentverse)

- Communicates in friendly style

- Powered by **Gemini 2.0 Flash**

- Generates natural, human-like replies

### 2. `Summary Agent` (hosted on Agentverse)

- Takes full conversation history and returns a **brief, friendly summary**

- Also uses **Gemini** to identify the real meaning behind casual chats

### 3. `Assistant Agent` (local)

- Coordinates the conversation

- Sends your message to the Chat Agent

- Collects replies and sends full history to Summary Agent when the dialogue ends

### 4. `Test Assistant Agent` (local test user)

- Imitates a real user sending multiple messages

- Simulates a full conversation flow for local testing


## 💡Example

User sends:
> "Hey! How’s your work? Did you see the news today? Let's catch up soon."

AI replies (via Chat Agent), maintains friendly tone and keeps conversation going.  
When the chat ends, Summary Agent returns:
> "**Summary:** Talked about work, the news, and planned to catch up soon. 🎯"
